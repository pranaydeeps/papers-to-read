Natural Language, Deep Learning and Related Papers to Read

### NLP - Conceptual

1. [Nested LSTMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10308.pdf): A novel RNN architecture with multiple levels of memory.
Nested LSTMs add depth to LSTMs via nesting as opposed to stacking
2. [What Do Recurrent Neural Network Grammars Learn About Syntax?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05774.pdf): Recurrent neural network grammars (RNNG) are a recently proposed probabilistic generative modeling family for natural  language. They show  state-of-the-art language modeling and parsing performance. We investigate what information they learn, from a linguistic perspective

### NLP - Machine Translation

1. [Learning to Parse and Translate Improves Neural Machine Translation](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-2012.pdf): A hybrid model, called NMT+RNNG, that learns to parse and translate by combining the recurrent neural network grammar into the attention-based neural machine translation.
2. [Sequence-to-Dependency Neural Machine Translation](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-1065.pdf): A novel Sequence-to-Dependency Neural Machine Translation (SD-NMT) method, in which the target word sequence and its corresponding dependency structure  are jointly constructed and modeled, and this structure is used as context to facilitate word generations.
3. [Improved Neural Machine Translation with a Syntax-Aware Encoder and Decoder](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-1177.pdf): (1) A bidirectional tree encoder which learns both sequential and tree structured representations; (2) A tree-coverage model that lets the attention depend on the source-side syntax. 

### NLP - Application

### Review/Overview

1. [An Overview of Multi-Task Learning in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05098.pdf): Aims to give a general overview of MTL, particularly in deep neural networks. It introduces the two most common methods for MTL in Deep Learning, gives an overview of the literature, and discusses recent advances

### Meta-Learning

1. [Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf)
2. [On First Order Meta-Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02999.pdf)
